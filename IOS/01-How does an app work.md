# How does an app work?

>   Smart phone are actually *no different from just any other computer* and *app is just code wrote to tell that mini “computer”what it should do*. 

There are only three components to every single mobile app.

When we think back to that plan we’re writing when we’re coding up the apps,then that plan has to *take into account all of the events that happen* not just when a button inside the app is tapped or when a user shake the phone but also things such as *when the operating system tells us that the user is getting a phone call,so our app is going to be switched into the background.*
